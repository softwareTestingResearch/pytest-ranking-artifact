# README

In this repository, we make available the scripts and data for our experiments on [`pytest-ranking`](https://github.com/softwareTestingResearch/pytest-ranking)

Each sub-folder provides a more detailed README on the sub-folder's content.

Overall,  `project_selection_scripts` contains the scripts to curate candidate evaluation projects from PyPI. `rerun_test_build_scripts` contains the scripts to collect build data, rerun historical builds/commits, and analyze and compute experiment results.
